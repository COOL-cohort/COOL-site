# Introduction to COOL

Apache COOL is an online cohort analytical processing system that supports various types of data analytics, including cube query, iceberg query and cohort query. The objective of COOL is to provide high performance (near real-time) analytical response for emerging data warehouse domain.
COOL is a cohort OLAP system specialized for cohort analysis with extremely low latency. As the first OLAP system, which can process both cohort queries and conventional OLAP queries, COOL outperforms other systems by a wide margin in single-node setting. Its multi-node version can also beat other systems by one order of magnitude in terms of query latency.

The common applications of COOL are:

- To be continued.
- **Healthcare.**
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Analytics.**
- **Electronic medical record analysis**
- **Retention analysis in financial area**
- **Anomaly detection in physical system**
- **Anti-fraud in e-commerce platform**
- **Advertising analytics**

## Key features of COOL

1. **Easy to use.** COOL provides user-friendly API, thus allowing users to easily deploy a web app to utilize COOL on local or on cloud via docker.
2. **Near Real-time Responses.** COOL is highly efficient, and therefore, can process cohort queries in near real-time analytical responses.
3. **Scalable distributed architecture.** COOL can be extened for distributed processing to serve big data needs without compromising the ability and efficiency in supporting both OLAP and cohort queries.
4. **Specialized Storage Layout.** A specialized storage layout is designed for fast query processing and reduced space consumption.
5. **Self-designed Semantics.** There are some novel self-designed semantics for the cohort query, which can simplify its complexity and improve its functionality.
6. **Flexible Integration.** Since COOL supports various types of data, it can be integrated with other data systems via common data formats e.g., CSV, Parquet, Avro, and Arrow. This also makes COOL suitable for many different application scenarios.
7. **Artificial Intelligence Model.** Utilize COOL's cohort results and findings to facilitate building artificial intelligence models.
